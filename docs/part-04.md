# Windows GUI-stuff in C++: a tutorial.

## Part 4 ‚Äì UTF-8 as the one and only text encoding.

In the previous version there was a character encoding problem, that a right single quote mark in a C++ string literal, would not necessarily be displayed correctly.

The problem happened because the controls in a window assume that `char` based text is encoded with the process‚Äô **Windows ANSI** encoding, the encoding specified by the `GetACP` function, which is usually some variant of Windows ANSI Western, whereas the encoding for a C++ literal typically is UTF-8 ‚Äî at least for experienced programmers.

So, in this part we‚Äôll change everything to UTF-8 encoding. Which involves telling the tools that they should assume and produce UTF-8. This gets rid of the right single quote problem, and also enables use of some fancy Unicode characters. üòÉ

### 4.1. Some background info.

The [**Unicode** character set](https://home.unicode.org/basic-info/faq/) is the basis of a number of possible text encodings, where the most popular in Windows are `char`-based UTF-8 and `wchar_t`-based UTF-16.

In Windows **`wchar_t`** is 16 bits, whereas in Linux and other Unixes in general it‚Äôs 32 bits, then because they use UTF-32. The C and C++ standards apparently reasonably insist that a single `wchar_t` should suffice for any code point in the character set, which requires 32 bits for a Unicode `wchar_t`. But both language standards are at odds with the roughly 30 years existing practice in the major desktop OS platform, i.e. the language standards are stuck in an academic denial mode. But no C or C++ compiler for Windows would be practically usable with 32-bits `wchar_t`, so no formally conforming compiler will be created. The ***effective C++ standard*** in Windows is one where `wchar_t` can be, and is, 16 bits.

The Windows core functionality is based on UTF-16 encoding, but `<windows.h>` defaults to offering wrapper functions that convert `char` based text to `wchar_t` based UTF-16, and vice versa. For example, when we used `MessageBox` we used a macro that was defined as `MessageBoxA`, the message box function that takes `char` based string arguments. This function just translates the text to `wchar_t` based UTF-16 and calls `MessageBoxW` (suffix ‚ÄúA‚Äù for ‚ÄúANSI‚Äù and suffix ‚ÄúW‚Äù for ‚Äúwide‚Äù).

UTF-16 is Windows‚Äô variant of **wide text**, what the ‚Äú`w`‚Äù in `wchar_t` is about. As an example, `L"Hello!"` is a wide string literal with 7 16-bit `wchar_t` values, corresponding to the **narrow text** literal `"Hello!"` that has 7 `char` values, which are 8 bits each in Windows. And as an example, you can use `MessageBoxW` directly with wide string literals like `L"Hello!"` as arguments, with the text containing any Unicode symbol supported by the message box font (other characters can be rendered e.g. as rectangles).

Up [until June 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/globalizing/use-utf8-code-page#set-a-process-code-page-to-utf-8) one had to use UTF-16 encoded wide text in that way in any serious Windows desktop programming, because that was the only Unicode encoding supported by the API functions.

However, from June 2019 Windows supports using UTF-8 as a process‚Äô `char`-based encoding, i.e. the process‚Äô ANSI encoding, the one specified by [`GetACP()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnls/nf-winnls-getacp). Also, from this point on a Windows locale can have UTF-8 as its text encoding. And a C or C++ locale can therefore also have UTF-8 encoding provided that the C or C++ standard library implementation supports that.

The UTF-8 support is far from complete, neither complete in Windows nor in the C and C++ standard libraries. For example, last I checked, in the Windows API the `DrawText` function assumed the system‚Äôs `char`-based encoding such as Windows ANSI Western, instead of the process‚Äô `char`-based encoding that you‚Äôve set to UTF-8, and for example, only the pure ASCII subset of UTF-8 is supported for input from consoles, precluding e.g. Norwegian input. And as an example of (still as of this writing) missing C++ support, outputting `char` based text to a C++ wide stream such as `wcout`, may use the system‚Äô encoding.

However, together with earlier introduced UTF-8 support in the Visual C++ compiler and other Microsoft tools the June 2019 support in Windows *enables* use of UTF-8 throughout. This avoids encoding problems such as for the right single quote in the previous version of our Tic-Tac-Toe game. And it enables use of special Unicode characters provided that the font one uses, supports them.
