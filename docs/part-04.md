# Windows GUI-stuff in C++: a tutorial.

## Part 4 ‚Äì UTF-8 as the one and only text encoding.

In the previous version there was a character encoding problem, that a right single quote mark in a C++ string literal, would not necessarily be displayed correctly.

The problem happened because the controls in a window assume that `char` based text is encoded with the process‚Äô **Windows ANSI** encoding, the encoding specified by the `GetACP` function, which is usually some variant of Windows ANSI Western, whereas the encoding for a C++ literal typically is UTF-8 ‚Äî at least for experienced programmers.

So, in this part we‚Äôll change everything to UTF-8 encoding. Which involves telling the tools that they should assume and produce UTF-8. This gets rid of the right single quote problem, and also enables use of some fancy Unicode characters. üòÉ

### 4.1. Some background on Unicode in Windows programming.

TLDR: by using UTF-8 we are at the leading edge of Windows desktop software development where not all Windows‚Äô wrinkles have been ironed out yet, and we only support Windows versions since June 2019.

<p align="center">* * *</p>

The [**Unicode** character set](https://home.unicode.org/basic-info/faq/) is the basis of a number of possible text encodings, where the most popular in Windows are `char`-based UTF-8 and `wchar_t`-based UTF-16.

UTF-16 encoded text is a sequence of 16-bit encoding values which in Windows C and C++ programming are of type **`wchar_t`**. The ‚Äú`w`‚Äù in `wchar_t` stands for **wide text**, text represented with ‚Äú`wide`‚Äù encoding values. In C and C++ you can express wide text literals with prefix **`L`**, e.g. `L"Hello!"`.

But note: in Linux and other Unixes `wchar_t` is in general 32 bits, using UTF-32 encoding. So, while `L"Hello!"` is a sequence of 7 16-bit `wchar_t` values in Windows, it‚Äôs a sequence of 7 32-bit `wchar_t` values in Linux. Plus, some Unicode code points that can be represented with a single 32-bit `wchar_t` value in Linux, require two 16-bit `wchar_t` values in Windows, an UTF-16 **surrogate pair**, so that a wide literal doesn‚Äôt even always produce the same sequence of values in Linux and Windows.

When we used `MessageBox` like

~~~cpp
MessageBox( 0, "Some text in the box", "A title", MB_SETFOREGROUND );
~~~

‚Ä¶ we actually used a `<windows.h>` macro that was defined as `MessageBoxA`, the message box function that takes `char` based string arguments:

~~~cpp
MessageBoxA( 0, "Some text in the box", "A title", MB_SETFOREGROUND );
~~~

This function just translates the text to `wchar_t` based UTF-16 and calls `MessageBoxW` (suffix ‚ÄúA‚Äù for ‚ÄúANSI‚Äù and suffix ‚ÄúW‚Äù for ‚Äúwide‚Äù), as if one had coded

~~~cpp
MessageBoxW( 0, L"Some text in the box", L"A title", MB_SETFOREGROUND );
~~~

That is, the Windows core functionality is based on UTF-16 encoding, but `<windows.h>` defaults to offering wrapper functions that convert `char` based text to `wchar_t` based UTF-16, and vice versa. This wrapper layer originated as a compatibility layer for old non-Unicode `char` based applications. The intent was, in the early and mid 1990‚Äôs, that new Windows programs should use wide text, e.g. `MessageBoxW`.

And up [until June 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/globalizing/use-utf8-code-page#set-a-process-code-page-to-utf-8) one had to use UTF-16 encoded wide text in that way in any serious Windows desktop programming, because that was the only Unicode encoding supported by the API functions. One then defined the macro symbol **`UNICODE`** before including `<windows.h>`, so that `<windows.h>` would define the function-name macros to map to the ‚ÄúW‚Äù functions. For example, with `UNICODE` defined before `<windows.h>` is included, it defines `MessageBox` as `MessageBoxW`.

However, from June 2019 Windows supports using UTF-8 as a process‚Äô `char`-based encoding, i.e. the process‚Äô ANSI encoding, the one specified by [`GetACP()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnls/nf-winnls-getacp). Also, from this point on a Windows locale can have UTF-8 as its text encoding. And a C or C++ locale can therefore also have UTF-8 encoding provided that the C or C++ standard library implementation supports that.

With this the `char` based wrapper layer, the ‚ÄúA‚Äù suffix functions like `MessageBoxA`, has been *re-purposed to support the future* instead of supporting the past, just now with the ‚ÄúA‚Äù very much a misleading misnomer. This is  much like how C++ `auto` was re-purposed to support the future instead of supporting the past, just now with the ‚Äúauto‚Äù very much a misleading misnomer‚Ä¶ Well, I guess there must be an example also in the human body, maybe.

Anyway, as of early 2022 the UTF-8 support is far from complete.

But together with earlier introduced UTF-8 support in the Visual C++ compiler and other Microsoft tools the June 2019 support in Windows *enables* use of UTF-8 throughout. This avoids text encoding problems such as for the right single quote in the previous version of our Tic-Tac-Toe game. And it enables use of special Unicode characters provided that the font one uses, supports them.

### 4.2. Specify UTF-8 as the process‚Äô ANSI codepage.

Text fields and other controls assume that text is encoded with the process‚Äô ANSI text encoding, the **code page** specified by the `GetACP` ‚Äî short for ‚Äúget ANSI code page‚Äù ‚Äî function.

[‚ÄúCode page‚Äù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page) is an old alternative term for ‚Äútext encoding‚Äù, originally referring to a practice of displaying a complete old times‚Äô text encoding table such as ASCII on a single page of paper. Each code page has an identifying number (note: other vendors do not necessarily use the Microsoft code page numbers). For example, for Windows ANSI Western `GetACP` returns **1252**, and for UTF-8 it returns **65001**.

Codepage numbers are used for Windows‚Äô global text encoding assumptions, e.g. in the registry value ‚ÄúHKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\CodePage@ACP‚Äù that more or less undocumented specifies the default for `GetACP`. I‚Äôve found experimentally that it generally works to set that to 65001, with a reboot of Windows, and then there‚Äôs no need to set particular processes‚Äô ANSI codepage. But I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs supported or whether it‚Äôs at all a good idea, and hence I don‚Äôt use it.

Codepage numbers are also used for the [API functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/setconsoleoutputcp) and commands ([chcp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/chcp), [mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mode#select-code-page)) to set a console window‚Äôs **active code page**, the text encoding that it should assume, to a specific code page number. 

Unfortunately Microsoft doesn‚Äôt offer a function to set a process‚Äô ANSI code page. I.e. there‚Äôs no ‚Äúsetter‚Äù counterpart to `GetACP`, there‚Äôs no `SetACP`. Instead it has to be done [via the XML application manifest resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/globalizing/use-utf8-code-page#set-a-process-code-page-to-utf-8), like this:

[*part-04/code/tic-tac-toe/v6/resources/app-manifest.xml*](part-04/code/tic-tac-toe/v6/resources/app-manifest.xml)

Compared to a hypothetical `SetACP(65001)` call the above is exceedingly complex and over-engineered, not to mention brittle (get a space wrong and it doesn‚Äôt work). It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Well, it‚Äôs Microsoft.

Instead of the simple hypothetical `SetACP` call one must have something like the above monstrosity, *plus* a call like `assert(GetACP()==65001)`, or alternatively using the symbolic name for that codepage value, `CP_UTF8`.

### 4.3. Specify UTF-8 as the ‚Äú.rc‚Äù resource script codepage.

Converting the existing Windows ANSI-encoded ‚Äúresources.rc‚Äù resource script to UTF-8 can be done via your editor. With some editors, such as the one in Visual Studio, the encoding choice appears (directly or indirectly) in the ‚ÄúSave as‚Ä¶‚Äù dialog. And with some editors, such as Notepad++, it‚Äôs a separate place in the menus:

![Encoding conversion in Notepad++](part-04/images/sshot-2.encoding-conversion-in-notepad++.png)

Alternatively you can use commands to convert, e.g. [`Set-Content` in Windows Powershell](https://superuser.com/questions/1163753/converting-text-file-to-utf-8-on-windows-command-prompt).

But how to communicate the ‚Äú.rc‚Äù file‚Äôs encoding to the resource compiler, so that it won‚Äôs mess up e.g. round quote characters?

Well, there are three mechanisms:

* An [UTF-8 **BOM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8), a special Unicode character at the start of the file, tells Windows editors that the file is UTF-8 encoded. It may and should also tell a resource compiler that. But with e.g. Microsoft‚Äôs `rc` it doesn‚Äôt.
* A `#pragma code_page(65001)` at the top of the file tells or should tell a resource compiler to please, assume UTF-8 encoding for the rest.
* A command option, such as with Microsoft‚Äôs `rc` option `/c 65001`, can force the resource compiler to assume the specified encoding.

Just a decade ago (or so) Unix tools did in general not understand the UTF-8 BOM and could choke on it, while Windows tools required it. It was a dilemma. Visual C++ required it in order to understand that source code was UTF-8 encoded, while GNU‚Äôs g++ compiler choked on it.

And in an ironic reversal of roles, now Microsoft‚Äôs `rc` *chokes on the BOM* unless one uses the `/c 65001` option, while the MinGW toolchain‚Äôs `windres` is happy with it. Again, Microsoft. Or something.
