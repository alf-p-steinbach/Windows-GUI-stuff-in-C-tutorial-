# Windows GUI-stuff in C++: a tutorial.

Desktop Windows programming starting from the ground up, in C++17.

The first part, ❝A Windows GUI “Hello, world!”❞, is [here](tutorial/part-01.md).

 and the contents listing is [here](tutorial/contents.md).

The first part is, of course, the classic “Hello, world!” as a minimal Windows GUI program.

When you get this to work you’ve learned how to use your tools to create a GUI program, you’ve learned how to find documentation of things, and you’ve established working starter code, which enables further exploration and learning.

I haven’t decided how far to take this. I’ll add more as I have free time to fill, maybe once a week or two weeks. Free time include those times when I get too bored with other stuff.
